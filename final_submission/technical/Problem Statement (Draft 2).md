## **Problem Statement (Draft 2)**

### **Inventory Management Inefficiencies:**

Users are unable to create, assign, organize, or monitor tasks with the present task management system. This results in a disorganized work environment, unclear roles, and missed deadlines. The workflow becomes disorganized and imprecise when tasks are not assigned or tracked clearly.

### **Data Management Challenges:**

Important information is hard to find because of the client's antiquated and ineffective data processing techniques. Inefficient use of data and discrepancies result from the lack of a centralized data repository. The company's capacity for wise decision-making and peak performance is hampered by this disarray.

### **Manual Processes and Outdated Technologies:**

Task management efficiency is reduced when antiquated technologies and laborious manual procedures are used. Task completion times are longer and error rates are higher in the absence of automation technologies. The system's efficiency and dependability are impacted by the absence of contemporary development tools.

### **Security Vulnerabilities:**

Because the existing system is not equipped with strong security measures, important task data is susceptible to hostile assaults and illegal access. Important data may be compromised by inadequate data encryption and shoddy user authentication, endangering user privacy and system integrity.

### **Lack of Prioritization and Tracking:**

- Current methods do not adequately support task prioritization or provide effective tracking mechanisms. Users struggle to prioritize their workload and often rely on personal judgment or rudimentary systems that do not scale well.
- Tracking task progress and completion is often manual and lacks real-time updates, making it difficult to assess the current status of projects and identify potential bottlenecks.


### **Deadlines and Reminders Management:**

Setting and managing deadlines and reminders with the current tools is difficult. Users often miss deadlines because there are no automatic reminders, which affects project timelines. Manually setting deadlines and reminders is prone to mistakes, causing missed or incorrect deadlines.

### **Summary**

Task organization inefficiencies, antiquated data management procedures, a reliance on manual processes, and serious security flaws afflict the client's present task management system. Together, these problems impair decision-making, productivity, and data security, calling for a thorough redesign to satisfy contemporary efficiency and security requirements.
